# Creating a tuple using () , we use tuple when we don't want to change the values
t = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Cannot update values in tuple
# t[0] = 22  # Throws an error

# t1 = () # It is an empty tuple
# t1 = (1) # wrong way to declare a tuple with single element , t1 = (1) it shows it as a number not as a tuple
# t1 = (1, ) # Tuple with single element

# Tuple Methods
# 1. count()  2. index()   ..............

b = (1, 2, 4, 1, 5, 2, 4)
# print(b.count(1)) # it return number of times '1' occurs in tuple 'b'
# Which mean it shows how many elements present in tuple 'b' ; example 1 in b  repeats 2 times

# print(b.index(5)) # it return the index of element '5'
